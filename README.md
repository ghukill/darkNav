# darkNav

<p>darkNav is an exploration of random movement in a confined space.  It takes inspiration from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RoboSport">RoboSport</a>, the classic Maxis game, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RoboRally">RoboRally</a>, a phenomenal boardgame.</p>

<p>At this time, it's command line options driven and mostly just for making graphs, with plans to include collision analysis and see what kind of mayhem that introduces.</p>

## I've had the sudden realization I'm remaking the spectacular, widely loved, and classic Windows screensaver: <strong>3D Pipes</strong>
